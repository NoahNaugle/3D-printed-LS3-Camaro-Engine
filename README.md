# 3D printed LS3 Camero Engine
Fully 3D printed LS3 Camero engine <br>
Took 500 hours of printing on a desktop cr-10 printer. <br>
And 100 hours of sanding, priming, painting and assembling. <br>

The model was not created by me but rather @ericthepoolboy. He was a few other incredibly detailed engines. <br>

I have a lot of in progress pictures I took of the build process I would like to add soon and describe how I got to the final.
